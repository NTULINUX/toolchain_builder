# toolchain_builder
NTU's bleeding edge toolchain builder

A complete native x86/amd64 toolchain builder,
written entirely in Bash.

Probably needs a more creative project name.

Recent changes:
* Lots of clean up
* Stage 2 build of Binutils, GLIBC, and GCC
* Kernel headers bump to 4.8.11
* Misc features and function adjustments
* Switch to Binutils master (many error fixes)
* Switch to GLIBC master (math fixes)
* More rodeo and cowbell
* Hopefully easier to read!
