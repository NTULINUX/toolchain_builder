# toolchain_builder
NTU's bleeding edge toolchain builder

A complete native x86/amd64 toolchain builder,
written entirely in Bash.

Probably needs a more creative project name.

Recent changes:
* Improved config handling
* Now passes ShellCheck with no potential issues
* Kernel headers bump to 4.12.4
* Fix sanity check for non-hardened Gentoo systems
